         <p>There’s been a lot of talk about light pollution in the mainstream media lately, with discussion about its impact on local wildlife, human health, avian migrations, and stargazing.
         
         “In a primal sense,” writes Nadia Drake in National Geographic, “we’ve lost our connection to nighttime skies, the tapestries into which our ancestors wove their star-studded stories, timed the planting and harvesting of crops, and deduced the physical laws governing the cosmos.”
         <br><br>
         Even The Washington Post ran a recent article about increased light pollution    resulting from the adoption of LED streetlights in Washington State’s Chelan  County: “One year after the change began, the additional glare masked about half  of the previously visible stars.” While we’re using less energy with individual   LED bulbs, their economy and longevity lead towns and facilities to use more of    them, which only increases the glow. Their light is also typically at bluer   wavelengths that scatter more easily. As a result, we’re now seeing roughly 10%    more light pollution each year.
         <br>
         We’re losing our night sky views at an alarming rate.
         <br>
         There are designated dark-sky communities, dedicated to reducing light pollution    for the good of humans and wildlife alike, so I don’t despair that future  generations will lose all access to the stars. But, here and now, it’s downright  dispiriting to look up at night and imagine everything I cannot see.
